## Industry Pain Points {#pain-spot}

- **Disconnected File Transfer and Review Systems**

  Many companies have separate systems for FTP and file review, which leads to inefficiency in file flow and increases software maintenance costs and the cognitive load on users.

- **Complex FTP Commands and Environment**

  FTP/SFTP commands are numerous. Although daily operations may only require memorizing a few commands, for users without Linux or IT backgrounds or non-technical companies, FTP commands remain too complex. Users may also need to deal with complicated internal network environment differences.

- **Complicated or Absent Review Processes**

  While many companies implement intranet and extranet isolation, their approach to file review often falls into one of two extremes: either completely neglecting it (unsafe) or having overly complicated processes (inefficient).

## Advantages of FileNexus {#advantage}

- **Docker Packaging, Rapid Deployment**

  FileNexus packages the entire system into a Docker image, eliminating the need for complex installation steps. It doesn’t affect the existing system environment, and with just one line of code, you can quickly deploy it to a server.

- **Visual Operation, Usable by IT Novices**

  Whether users are uploading/downloading files or administrators are reviewing and configuring the management system, all processes in FileNexus are completed through a browser interface with simple visual operations, making it easy for those who don’t understand FTP to use.

- **Transfer + Review, Efficient Aggregation**

  File transfer and review are handled in one system, making it convenient and efficient.

- **Transfer Large Files with Ease**

  Using a new file chunking upload and resume transfer technology, even ordinary browsers can easily transfer large files.

## Use Cases {#use-cases}

- **Large companies needing to optimize file management processes**

- **Small and medium-sized companies needing a low-cost file review system**

- **Development teams needing to quickly deploy an FTP system**

- **Non-tech companies with file transfer needs but no IT support**
